# Ferry-Loading
##### There is an l-meter-long ferry that crosses the river. A car may arrive at either river bank to be transported by the ferry to the opposite bank. The ferry travels continuously back and forth between the banks so long as it is carrying a car or there is at least one car waiting at either bank. Whenever the ferry arrives at one of the banks, it unloads its cargo and loads up cars that are waiting to cross as long as they fit on its deck. The cars are loaded in the order of their arrival and the ferry's deck accommodates only one lane of cars. The ferry is initially on the left bank where it had mechanical problems and it took quite some time to fix it. In the meantime, lines of cars formed on both banks that wait to cross the river.

# __Prerequesites__
##### [C](http://www.cyberprogrammers.net/2015/11/top-9-best-cc-ides-for-windowsmac-os.html) needs to be used in order to run this program. Follow the link provided that shows some C/C++ IDEs that could be used to run the program. 
# __Running the Program__
##### The functions to test the program must be written in text file and the used in main.c file. The first line of input contains c, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with the number l, a space and then the number m. m lines follow describing the cars that arrive in this order to be transported. Each line gives the length of a car (in centimeters), and the bank at which the car awaits the ferry ("left" or "right").
